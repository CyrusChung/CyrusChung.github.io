Finally my first blog site is published!

Lots of cool functions provided by <a href = "http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> are not tested. Nevertheless, the pages I reservered for categorize my posts, or maybe put somethings else, are not deployed yet. But at least...I can say <b>"This site is opening!!"</b>

终于完成了一部分工作了，不过这个blog还差很大一部分没完成，之后还要再慢慢完善……不过先放着吧~哈哈哈哈哈

以后再慢慢修改吧~将就着看呗先……
